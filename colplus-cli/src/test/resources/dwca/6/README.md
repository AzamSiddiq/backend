Tests the Index Fungorum format using a denormed classification.

All records of the genus ZignoÃ«lla have been included in the test resources,
as only when all are present the original issue of missing higher taxa shows up.
The genus field is left out in the meta.xml, as it causes confusion when the genus is regarded as a synonyms,
but there are species within that genus still being accepted. An oddity of the nomenclatoral index fungorum
database.
Discovered with this test.

Test a synonym which should use the classification of the accepted name, not the (wrong) denormed of the synonym:
