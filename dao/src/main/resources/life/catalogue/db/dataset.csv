1014,TAXONOMIC,,,CC_BY,2020-04-23,5,100,EXTERNAL,ICTV Master Species List,ICTV MSL,"The 7th lCTV Report formalized for the first time the concept of the virus species as the lowest taxon (group) in a branching hierarchy of viral taxa. As defined therein, “a virus species is a polythetic class of viruses that constitute a replicating lineage and occupy a particular ecological niche”. A “polythetic class” is one whose members have several properties in common, although they do not necessarily all share a single common defining property. In other words, the members of a virus species are defined collectively by a consensus group of properties. Virus species thus differ from the higher viral taxa, which are “universal” classes and as such are defined by properties that are necessary for membership.

Viruses are real physical entities produced by biological evolution and genetics, whereas virus species and higher taxa are abstract concepts produced by rational thought and logic. The virus/species relationship thus represents the front line of the interface between biology and logic.
Viruses (including virus isolates, strains, variants, types, sub-types, serotypes, etc.) should wherever possible be assigned as members of the appropriate virus species, although many viruses remain unassigned because they are inadequately characterized.
All virus species must be represented by at least one virus isolate.
Almost all virus species are members of recognized genera. A few species remain unassigned in their families although they have been clearly identified as new species.
Some genera are members of recognized sub-families.
All sub-families and most genera are members of recognized families. Some genera are not yet assigned to a family; in the future they may either join an existing family or constitute a new family with other unassigned genera.
Some families are members of the following recognized orders: Caudovirales, Nidovirales and Mononegavirales.
The hierarchy of recognized viral taxa is therefore:

(Order), Family, (Sub-family), Genus, Species

Only the aforementioned taxa are recognized by the ICTV. Other groupings (from clade to super-family), may communicate useful descriptive information in some circumstances but they have no formally recognized taxonomic meaning. Similarly, the term “quasi-species”, although it captures an important concept, has no recognized taxonomic meaning.
The creation or elimination, (re)naming, and (re)assignment of a virus species, genus, (sub)family, or order are all taxonomic acts that require public scrutiny and debate, leading to formal approval by the full membership of the ICTV. In contrast, the naming of a virus isolate and its assignment to a pre-existing species are not considered taxonomic acts and therefore do not require formal ICTV approval. Instead they will typically be accomplished by publication of a paper describing the virus isolate in the peer-reviewed virology literature.","MSL35, 2019, v1",Global,Viruses,https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/w/ictv-taxonomy,https://github.com/Sp2000/colplus-repo/raw/master/logos/ICTV_MSL.png,,"{""data access"": ""http://rs.gbif.org/datasets/ictv.zip"", ""data format"": ""coldp"", ""import frequency"": 30, ""nomenclatural code"": ""virus""}",,"(,,info@ictvonline.org,,,,,,,,,)","{""(,,\""Davison, Andrew J.\"",,,,,,,,,)"",""(,Stuart,Siddell,,,,,,,,,)"",""(,Arcady,Mushegian,,,,,,,,,)"",""(,,\""Walker, Peter J.\"",,,,,,,,,)"",""(,,\""Lefkowitz, Elliot J.\"",,,,,,,,,)"",""(,,\""Adriaenssens, Evelien\"",,,,,,,,,)"",""(,Balázs,Harrach,,,,,,,,,)"",""(,,\""Kuhn, Jens H.\"",,,,,,,,,)"",""(,,\""Knowles, Nick J.\"",,,,,,,,,)"",""(,Peter,Simmonds,,,,,,,,,)"",""(,,\""Zerbini, F.

This is an internationally coordinated effort involving over 40 bryologists from more than 16 countries. The data presented here is based on the first-ever worldwide checklist for liverworts (Marchantiophyta) and hornworts (Anthocerotophyta) published in 2016 and some recent updates after that. The checklist and the CoL data are derived from a working database centralizing nomenclature, taxonomy and geography on a global scale.

The data includes all extant taxa for liverworts and hornworts and macrofossils closely related to them. Prior to this effort a lack of centralization was a major impediment for the study and analysis of species richness, conservation and systematic research at both regional and global scales. The checklist as well as a list of contributors can be accessed at: https://doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.59.6261.

Some 200+ species have been described  based on descriptions from adult stages plus 50 species based on the description from juvenile stages. Species known only from juvenile stages are generally regarded as nomina dubia, but names are available and valid according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

Foraminifera (‘hole bearers’) or forams for short, are a large phylum of amoeboid protozoans (single celled) with reticulating pseudopods, fine strands of cytoplasm that branch and merge to form a dynamic net. They usually produce a test (or shell) which can have one or more chambers, and are made of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or mineral grains or other particles glued together. The tests are usually less than 0.5 mm in size, but the largest can be up to 20 cm across. Foraminifera are among the most abundant and scientifically important groups of marine organisms. The tests of recently dead planktic foraminifera are so abundant that they form a thick blanket over one third of the surface of the Earth (as Globigerina ooze on the ocean floor). Foraminifera are essentially marine- and estuarine-dwelling protozoans living in all environments from the greatest depths right up to highest astronomical tide level and from the equator to the poles.

The importance of foraminifera comes from the use of their fossil tests in biostratigraphy, paleoenvironmental studies, and isotope geochemistry. Their ubiquity in most marine sedimentary rocks, often as large, well-preserved, diverse assemblages, has resulted in their being the most studied group of fossils worldwide. Because modern foraminifera have attracted little interest from biologists, paleontologists have been forced to undertake most studies, including genetic research, on the living fauna.
This site has the following aims:
    to provide a catalogue of the world's foraminiferal species
    to promote stability in foraminiferal nomenclature
    to act as a tool for higher taxonomic revisions and regional monographs",ver.

Users can get the name list of one group of organisms through keywords search, species name searching, or image searching etc. Further information of each species can be obtained through the hyperlink to more than 18 well-known global databases or networks, such as Species2000 and ITIS etc. Right now, more than 30,000 species have been compiled, and we hope to collect more than 60,000 species by July 2004.

This dataset contains the information on 93 bufonid and 11 megophryid type specimens representing 27 taxa in 2 families under consideration. Among them 16 taxa are currently recognized as valid species or subspecies.
The main portion of the collection of amphibian type specimens was formed as a result of systematic works by Russian and foreign specialists that described new species and subspecies in collections of the Zoological Institute. For example, 13 new taxa of amphibians were described by the Russian herpetologist, A. M. Nikolsky. Moreover, other new forms were described by J. von Bedriaga, A. A. Strauch, and S. Th. Tzarewsky. Recently a number of new species were described by N. L. Orlov on the basis of collections in the Zoological Institute from South-East Asia.
An important part of the specimens was received from different zoological museums around the world. A. A. Strauch, director of Zoological Institute from 1879 to 1890 and a great Russian herpetologist, conducted an exchange of herpetological collections with museums in London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Copenhagen, Stuttgart, Brussels and Frankfurt am Main and with private persons such as De Betta in Verona, F. Lataste in Paris, V. L. Seoane in La Coruña, and well-known dealer Schneider in Basel. As a result, the Zoological Museum (now Institute) enriched itself from many new species including its original and authors’ specimens (Strauch, 1889). Many type specimens were received as a gift or in exchange from the Zoologisches Museum, Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin in 1857 and 1982; Warsaw Museum in 1871; Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris in 1879; British Museum (Nat. Hist.), London in 1884 and 1892; Turin Museum of Natural History in 1896; Staatliches Museum für Tierkunde, Dresden; Cambridge University Museum in 1927; and Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago in 1959. In 1885 several specimens were bought from the Linnaea Institute situated in Frankfurt am Main and later in Berlin. This firm purchased animals from various collectors and identified them and then sold the specimens to museums. A herpetological collection from Paraguay described by O. Boettger was bought from H. Rodhe. Later a part of this collection including Boettgers’ types (Bufo levicristatus and others) went to St. Petersburg. In the 19 – early 20 century collection has grown rapidly due to extensive materials collected by expeditions of N. M. Przhewalsky, P. K. Kozlov, A. N. Kaznakov, M. V. Pewzow, G. Potanin, G. E. Grum-Grzhimailo and S. N. Alpheraky in Central Asia and Turkestan, N. A. Zarudny in Persia and other famous voyagers.

They belong to genera Cosmopterix Hübner, [1825] (27 species), Vulcaniella Riedl, 1965 (5), Hodgesiella Riedl, 1965 (2), Labdia Walker, 1864 (2), Ressia Sinev, 1988 (2), Coccidiphila Danilevsky, 1950 (1), Pyroderces Herrich-Schäffer, 1853 (1), Anatrachyntis Meyrick, 1915 (1), Gracilosia Sinev, 1989 (1), Minivalva Sinev, 1989 (1), Diversivalva Sinev, 1991 (1), and Eteobalea Hodges, 1962 (1) from the subfamily Cosmopteriginae, Pancalia Stephens, 1829 (4) and Alloclita Staudinger, 1859 (1) from the subfamily Antequerinae.
A collection of Cosmopterigidae is a part of general world-wide collection of micromoths deposited in the Lepidoptera Department of the Laboratory of Insect Taxonomy of the Zoological Institute RAS. Its Palaearctic part is housed in the 52 standard wooden drawers with glass lids in 3 wooden cabinets and comprises above 7500 pinned, labelled and identified specimens belonging to 22 genera and 105 species (90 % and 86 % of Palaearctic taxa, respectively). The primary types are kept separately in the individual boxes inside two standard wooden drawers. Collection also includes over 900 micropreparates of genitalia kept in alcohol-glycerol blend, and about 50 microslides of genitalia fixed in Euparal. Besides the Palaearctic taxa (primarily from the former Russian Empire and Soviet Union and adjacent countries), collection of Cosmopterigidae comprises also different taxa from Oriental (Vietnam, India, Laos, Thailand, Korea, China), Afrotropical, Nearctic and, to a lesser extent, Neotropical and Australian regions. The ‘exotic’ part of collection is housed in the 35 standard wooden drawers with glass lids and carton boxes in 2 wooden cabinets and comprises ca. 2500 pinned, labelled and partly identified specimens belonging to about 100 genera, and over 500 species.
In the past, cosmopterigid collection was not arranged as a separate unit. Its historical nucleus comprises by material accumulated from different sources during the XIX century and by the Lepidoptera collection of Grand Duke Nikolai Michailovich Romanoff. A special importance has collection of M.F. Wocke (bought by Romanoff and donated to the Zoological Museum in 1907) which comprised mostly western European taxa, and collection of E. Eversmann (donated via Russian Entomological Society in 1908) which comprised mostly taxa from the Volga-Ural region. All the above mentioned collections were stored separately until the 80th of XX century. At that time, the additional specimens collected by the staffs of Zoological Museum/Institute and other persons, chiefly remained among the unsorted Microlepidoptera material. The most important input to the collection was made by A.N. Diakonov, N.N. Filipjev, V.V. Ermolaev, and M.G. Ponomarenko (Russian Far East), A.K. Zagulajev (Transcaucasia, Crimea), I.M. Kerzhner (Mongolia), M.I. Falkovitsh and R.K. Puplesis [Stonis] (Central Asia), Yu.I. Budashkin (Crimea), A.L. Lvovsky and S.V. Baryshnikova (Central Asia, Russian Far East), V.I. Kuznetzov (Kuril Islands, Vietnam), M.M. Omelko (Primorskiy Territory, Laos), V.V. Dubatolov (Altai, Siberia, Amur basin), V.V. Anikin (Volga region, Mongolia, Central and South Africa), S.V. Nedoshivina and V.V. Zolotuhin (Vietnam), L.V. Bolshakov and A.G. Korobkov (European part).
Maintenance of the general collection in its present state, mounting and identification of the material has been performed during last 40 years by S.Yu. Sinev. Since1976, the collection has been enriched greatly (nearly doubled) by the materials of numerous field trips of the author to the Russian Far East (Primorskiy and Khabarovskiy territories, Sachalin, Kuril Islands), Transbaikalia, Altai, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Transcaucasia, Crimea, South Ural, Middle Volga region, Republic of Komi, Cola Peninsula, as well as to the Southern Korea, Iran, China, etc. Some cosmopterigid taxa including the paratypes of new species have been received in exchange or as a gift from F. Kasy (Austria), W. Mey and W. Speidel (Germany), A. Diakonoff and E. van Nieukerken (The Netherlands), O. Karsholt (Denmark), K.T. Park (Republic of Korea), J. De Prins (Belgium), R.W. Hodges (USA). The collection has been also enriched with the doublet specimens of the species submitted for the determination by the applied entomologists and amateur collectors. The most valuable part of the general collection, along with the primary types, comprise the numerous secondary types (paratypes, paralectotypes, ca. 650 specimens in total) of 68 species and subspecies. Among the secondary types, the taxa described by such famous lepidopterologists as W. Krone, H.G. Amsel, F. Kasy, T. Riedl, and A.K. Zagulajev are also represented.

It results from the collaborative work of many taxonomists from different Portuguese and foreign institutions (about 90 taxonomists), under the editorial coordination of the Azorean Biodiversity Group (http://www.gba.uac.pt). The total estimated number of terrestrial species and subspecies in the Madeira and Selvagens archipelagos was about 7,571 (7,452 species and 421 subspecies). Fungi and plants represent about 42% of the terrestrial diversity. However, animals dominate, arthropods being the majority (51%) of all recorded taxa. The total number of endemic species and subspecies from the Madeira and Selvagens archipelagos is about 1,419 (1,286 species and 182 subspecies), which represents 19% of the overall species diversity.

The""Brazilian List"", as it was popularly known, closed in November 2015 with the publication of five papers and their respective databases (see Download as above) dealing with the different groups of fungi and plants. We enthusiastically present, in 2016, the brand new system that houses the Brazilian Flora 2020 project, aiming to achieve Target 1 established for 2020 by the GSPC-CBD. This new project icludes provisions to include descriptions, identification keys and illustrations to all species of plants, algae and fungi known in the country. The Brazilian Flora 2020 project is part of the Reflora Programme and is being conducted with the support of the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr). At the moment has nearly 700 scientists working in a network to prepare the monographs. These researchers are also responsible for nomenclatural information and geographic distribution (coverage in Brazil, endemism and biomes), as well as valuable data regarding life forms, substrate and vegetation types for each species.

Almost all of them belong to the genera Acmaeodera Eshchshcholz, 1829 (20), Microacmaeodera Cobos, 1966 (1), Xantheremia Volkovitsh, 1979 (5), and Acmaeoderella Cobos, 1955 (36) from the largest polycestine tribe Acmaeoderini Kerremans, 1893; only 2 holotypes belong to the species of the genus Polycesta Dejean, 1833 from the nominotypic tribe Polycestini.
A polycestine collection is a part of general world-wide collection of the buprestid- or jewel-beetles (Elateriformia: Buprestoidea: Buprestidae) deposited in the Coleoptera Department of the Laboratory of Insect Taxonomy of the Zoological Institute RAS. Polycestine part is housed in the 38 standard wooden drawers with glass lids from about 300 drawers in 4 wooden cabinets occupied by general bupresid collection. It comprises above 13000 pinned, labelled and mostly identified specimens belonging to 12 tribes, 49 genera, and about 650 species (totally, 13 tribes, 49 genera, and about 1250 species world-wide; 92 %, 60 %, and nearly 52 % respectively) [29]. The bulk of the polycestine collection, approximately 520 species from 12 genera, consists of representatives of the most speciose tribe Acmaeoderini Kerremans, 1893 (above 700 species from 15 genera world-wide). Collection also includes about 1700 microslides of genitalia fixed in gelatin-glycerol gel, and nearly 500 double microslides of larval structures (one with mouth-parts, and another with exuvium and proventriculus) fixed in Faure-Berlese fluid (about 80 species from 23 genera and 12 tribes; the species of Acmaeoderini are predominate group). Microslides are kept on the special trays within cardboard boxes separately from general collection.
Polycestine collection comprises mostly Palaearctic taxa (primarily from the former Russian Empire and Soviet Union and adjacent countries), as well as Oriental, Nearctic, Neotropical, and, to a lesser extent, Afrotropical and Australian taxa. In the XIX – early XX century it has grown rapidly due to extensive materials collected by expeditions of E. Ménétriés (Brasil, Trancaucasia), P.K. Kozlov and G.E. Groom-Grzhimailo (Central Asia), D.K. Glazunov and A.P. Fedtschenko (Turkestan), N.A. Zarudnyi (Persia, Turkestan) and other famous voyagers. Numerous polycestine species have been received from foreign entomologists and insect dealers – O. Staudinger, H. Leder, and E. Reitter. Throughout the ХХ century, the collection have been enriched significantly by the materials of numerous collecting trips of Zoological Museum / Institute staff to Central Asia, the Transcaucasia, Mongolia and Vietnam; at the end of XX – beginning of XXI centuries the geography of these trips greatly expanded. Many new and rare species from Afghanistan and Vietnam were contributed to collection by the famous geologist and scarabaeid expert O.N. Kabakov as a gift. Extremely abundant and valuable polycestine species have been collected by the author during his numerous expeditions to the Middle Asia and Transcaucasia (1973–1993), and later to Mexico, Israel, Turkey, Canary Islands (Tenerife), Nepal, and China. A great number of species originated from the private collections belonged to Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, A.P. Semenov-Tian-Shansky, and much later, V.N. Stepanov, O.N. Kabakov, A.V. Alexeev, and others. Numerous world-wide polycestine taxa including the paratypes of new species have been received in exchange or as a gift from G. Novak and W. Barries (Austria), J. Obenberger, S. Bílý, P. Kabatek, V. Kubáň, S. Prepsl, P. Svoboda (Czech Republic), A. Descarpentries (France), M. Hornburg, S. Gottwald, H. Mühle, P. Brandl, M. Niehuis (Germany), D. Baiocchi, D. Gianasso, M.

Westcott, N. Woodley (USA), and many other buprestid experts and amateurs. The collection has been also enriched greatly with the doublet specimens of the species submitted for the determination by the applied entomologists and amateur collectors world-wide.
Maintenance of the general collection, mounting and identification of the material have been performed by the preparators and researchers E. Ménétriés, C. Mannerheim, A.F. Morawitz, V.I. Motschulsky, A.P. Semenov-Tian-Shansky, G.G. Jacobson, F.K. Lukjanovitsh, A.A. Richter, L.V. Arnoldi, A.V. Alexeev, M.Y. Kalashian, M.G. Volkovitsh. General collection comprises the primary types (holotypes, lectotypes and one neotype) of 64 species and subspecies of Polycestinae (synonyms included) represented in a great part by the Acmaeoderini species, as well as the secondary types (paratypes, paralectotypes, and syntypes) of 138 species and subspecies. Primary types belong chiefly to the species described by E. Ménétriés [1–2], A.P. Semenov-Tian-Shansky [3–8], V.N. Stepanov [9–10], M.G. Volkovitsh [11–28, 30], and some other specialists.

With diverse terrain and wide range of vertical elevations, Taiwan has tropical, subtropical, temperate, and frigid climate zones. These unique geographical conditions, coupled with the effect of habitat isolation, gave Taiwan its high biodiversity. The endemic species of Taiwan denotes the native plants and animals of Taiwan and its offshore islands such as Penghu Archipelago, Orchid Island, Green Island, etc. Even though the areas are small, the Checklist of Taiwan (TaiBNET) lists around 50,000 valid species scientific names. Among them, 8,000 are endemic species (including endemic subspecies and varietas), showing the abundance of Taiwan’s endemic Species. TaiBNET also provides information on these species, such as their scientific names (including authors and years), common names, and synonyms. Through Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), the information on these endemic species are published and then shared and exchanged with other GBIF participants. Users can use keywords to link to other websiteswith relevant information.

The genomes used to construct the phylogeny are obtained from RefSeq and Genbank, and GTDB releases are indexed to RefSeq releases, starting with release 76. Importantly and increasingly, this dataset includes draft genomes of uncultured microorganisms obtained from metagenomes and single cells, ensuring improved genomic representation of the microbial world. All genomes are independently quality controlled using CheckM before inclusion in GTDB, see statistics here. The genome tree on which the taxonomy is based is inferred using FastTree from an aligned concatenated set of 120 single copy marker proteins for Bacteria, and 122 marker proteins for Archaea (download page here). Additional marker sets are also used to cross-validate tree topologies including concatenated ribosomal proteins and ribosomal RNA genes. NCBI taxonomy was initially used to decorate the genome tree via tax2tree. The 16S rRNA-based Greengenes taxonomy is used to supplement the taxonomy particularly in regions of the tree with no cultured representatives.

for all described vascular plant species globally.
The Leipzig Catalogue of Vascular Plants (LCVP; version 1.0.3) contains 351,180 accepted species names (plus 6,160 natural hybrids),
within 13,460 genera, 564 families and 84 orders.
The LCVP a) contains more information on the taxonomic status of global plant names than any other similar resource,
and b) significantly improves the reliability of our knowledge by e.g. resolving the taxonomic status of ~181,000 names compared to The Plant List, the up to date most commonly used plant name resource.
We used ~4,500 publications, existing relevant databases and available studies on molecular phylogenetics to construct a robust reference backbone.

A guiding principle during the compilation of the LCVP was to avoid polyphyletic genera, which are frequent in TPL,
either by splitting genera (e.g. separating Goeppertia from Calathea)
or fusing them (e.g. Stapelia and Duvalia in Ceropegia).
However, we did not recombine any species name in the LCVP and in cases of unclear phylogenetic position of genera, we used the conservative (i.e. existing) name.
